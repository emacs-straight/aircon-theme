Aircon theme
============

Aircon is a clean and high contrast Custom theme for Emacs.  It
consists of a white (#ffffff) background and mostly blues, purples and
greens.  Highlights are subtle but easily visible.  The active
mode-line is white on blue to distinguish it from inactive mode-lines
which are dark blue on light grey.

Coverage includes:

-   Standard Faces
-   Font-Lock
-   Flyspell
-   Diff
-   Magit
-   Dired
-   Eshell
-   ANSI escape sequences (coloured terminal output)
